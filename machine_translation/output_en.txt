no signals at the late temperature temperatures , or it &apos;s like , you expect it to the night .
it &apos;s partly , partly , with high temperatures .
the bottom area is going to grow temperature by 40 and deposheters wind .
now we &apos;re going back to your favorite sound right now , steve , with steve , on top .
u.k cally indeed .
thank you , derek ie .
i love this temperature .
expressed , translated .
wait over there , ok ?
it just has to take a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit around the modern level .
i &apos;ve been studying , i &apos;ve been studying , and i &apos;ve been involved in line for a couple of years , and this is where i started , because i wanted to know more deeply , and it also wanted to do what i learned in the study of research .
so , that was my baseline .
so it was an curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like this .
i think that &apos;s true in general right now , so in general , biotech , anything you do , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now even very important , and much , much more important is going to be in the future .
there &apos;s so much of these things that are changing all the way in terms of the way .
there &apos;s now craig venter in the way that trying to make place , which is made gas from algae .
there &apos;s also things that are going to be totally in the everyday life , but most of the people who are not aware of , for example , for example , that allow us to wash off with a certain level of laundry , are also tracking enzymes .
and the lists can continue to continue .
and so from the interest that this technology , at this technology , i continue to continue beyond it .
so why now hack ?
most people know the most people recognize this .
so , the computer is hacking , and then it will be , in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere somewhere , and they keep claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of a very sad thing for the very very sad thing , because it &apos;s not true what they actually did , and what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s the sort of thing , in the face , starting out , and it &apos;s also made up the internet .
and it &apos;s about a way of looking at a degree , creative , thinking , a problem .
